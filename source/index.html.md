# Introduction

Welcome to the WebCode.How API! You can use our API to access our articles and site metrics that are available publicly.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). We at WebCode.How send a giant thank you to the team that built this wonderful tool.

# Authentication

WebCode.How's public API requires no authentication and has no set rate limits.

Abuse of the API will result in your IP being blocked. Please do NOT perform so many requests that it looks like abuse.
